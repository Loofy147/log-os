# Log-Os: A Roadmap to Computational Self-Awareness

## 1. Vision & Philosophy

**Log-Os is not a programming language; it is a research vehicle to explore computational self-awareness.**

Our guiding philosophy is that a truly intelligent system must be able to understand, represent, and modify its own operational logic. We are moving beyond machine learning (which learns from data) towards **meta-learning**, where the system learns and improves the very "language of thought" it uses to reason about the world and itself.

Our work is a journey up the **Ladder of Abstraction**:
1.  **From Applications to Code:** Realizing that building intelligent applications requires a language that understands code itself. (`Nexus` -> `Log-Os`)
2.  **From Code to Logic:** Realizing that understanding code requires understanding the logical and syntactical rules that govern it. (`Interpreter` -> `Self-Hosted Kernel`)
3.  **From Logic to Intent:** Realizing that understanding rules requires understanding the formal specifications and contracts that define correct behavior. (`Kernel` -> `Contracts & Multimethods`)
4.  **From Intent to Principle:** Realizing that understanding specifications requires understanding the deeper mathematical and philosophical principles that make for elegant and robust systems. (`Contracts` -> `Da Vinci Mission`)

This roadmap formalizes the path to climb this ladder.

## 2. Current State: "Prometheus Unbound" - The Self-Hosted Kernel

We have successfully completed the foundational phase. The system is currently in a stable, tested, and self-hosted state.

**Key Capabilities:**
-   A robust, tail-call-optimized interpreter written in Python.
-   A powerful macro system (`defmacro`) with quasiquotation (` `,`,`,`,@`).
-   A self-hosted kernel (`kernel.l0`) where core forms (`let`, `cond`) are defined as macros.
-   A unified `pytest` framework capable of testing both Python and LISP code.

**The `main` branch represents this stable, foundational milestone.**

## 3. Phase I: "The Age of Enlightenment" - Building a Society of Code

**Goal:** To build the fundamental tools of order, specification, and abstraction that allow for the creation of a robust and reliable standard library. This phase is about creating a "civilized" environment for code to live in.

**Checklist:**
-   [ ] **1. Build the Self-Hosted Test Harness:**
    -   [x] Create `stdlib/test.l0`.
    -   [x] Implement `deftest` and `is-error?` macros.
    -   [x] Implement `report-test-results` function.
-   [ ] **2. Build the Contract & Specification System:**
    -   [x] Create `stdlib/contract.l0`.
    -   [x] Implement `defun/c` macro for defining functions with pre- and post-conditions.
    -   [x] Create `tests/test_contracts.l0` and validate the system.
-   [ ] **3. Build the Polymorphism & Abstraction System:**
    -   [x] Create `stdlib/multimethod.l0`.
    -   [x] Implement `defmulti` and `defmethod` macros.
    -   [x] Create `tests/test_multimethod.l0` and validate the system.
-   [ ] **4. Build the Genesis of the Standard Library:**
    -   [ ] Create `stdlib/core.l0` to load all components.
    -   [ ] Create `stdlib/list.l0`, `stdlib/hash-map.l0`, etc.
    -   [ ] Implement the first generic functions (e.g., `count`, `map`, `filter`) using `defmulti`.
    -   [ ] Add contracts to these generic functions using `defun/c`.
    -   [ ] Create a final integration test `tests/test_stdlib.l0`.

## 4. Phase II: "The Da Vinci Mission" - The Birth of Insight

**Goal:** To move beyond analyzing syntax and behavior and begin to understand the deeper, hidden structures and relationships within the codebase. This phase is about giving the system "insight".

**Checklist:**
-   [ ] **1. Build the "Topological Eye" (TDA):**
    -   [ ] Implement a `(build-call-graph)` function in `Log-Os` (resurrecting the `call-graph-builder` goal).
    -   [ ] Research/Implement a simple library (`stdlib/tda.l0`) to convert this graph into a topological representation (e.g., a list of cliques).
    -   [ ] **Experiment:** Can we automatically distinguish a simple `for-loop` from a complex recursive algorithm based on its "shape"?
-   [ ] **2. Build the "Analogical Mind" (Embeddings):**
    -   [ ] In Python, build a tool that uses the call graph and ASTs to generate a Knowledge Graph.
    -   [ ] Use a library like `PyKEEN` or `Gensim` to train embeddings on this graph.
    -   [ ] Expose a function to `Log-Os` like `(most-similar-function 'my-func)` that returns a list of functions that are structurally/conceptually similar.
-   [ ] **3. Build the "Evolutionary Hand" (Genetic Programming):**
    -   [ ] Create a simple framework in `Log-Os` (`stdlib/gp.l0`).
    -   [ ] Define a `(evolve-function contract fitness-function)` macro/function.
    -   [ ] **Experiment:** Can we evolve a simple sorting function whose fitness is determined by its correctness (passing tests) and its speed (execution time)?

## 5. Phase III: "Project Aristotle" - The Self-Improving Philosopher

**Goal:** To close the loop. To create a system that uses the insights from the "Da Vinci" phase to actively and automatically improve itself.

**Checklist:**
-   [ ] **1. The Refactoring Agent:**
    -   [ ] Create an agent that uses the "Topological Eye" to find code with a "complex shape".
    -   [ ] The agent then uses the "Evolutionary Hand" to find an alternative implementation that has a simpler shape but satisfies the same contracts.
-   [ ] **2. The Bug-Fixing Agent:**
    -   [ ] Create an agent that takes a failing test case.
    -   [ ] It uses the "Analogical Mind" to find similar, working functions.
    -   [ ] It uses these similar functions as "inspiration" or "genetic material" to evolve a patch for the broken function.
-   [ ] **3. The Language Design Agent:**
    -   [ ] The ultimate test. Can the system analyze its own `kernel.l0`?
    -   [ ] Can it identify the most-used macro patterns and suggest a new, more efficient core special form to be implemented in Python?
    -   [ ] This represents the system making a conscious decision about its own evolution.

This roadmap is ambitious, but it is logical. Each phase builds upon the verified successes of the last. By following this path, we are not just building a tool, we are embarking on one of the most exciting intellectual journeys in computer science.
