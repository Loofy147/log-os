;; bootstrap/call-graph-builder.l0
;; The goal of this program is to perform a semantic analysis of the entire
;; Log-Os codebase (.l0 files) and build a complete call graph.
;; This will demonstrate a deeper, semantic understanding of the code.

;; High-level plan:
;; 1. Load the necessary analysis tools from the standard library.
;;    (load "stdlib/analysis/scope-analyzer.l0")
;;    (load "stdlib/analysis/dependency-analyzer.l0")
;;
;; 2. Define a function, (build-project-graph root-dir), that will:
;;    a. Use the (list-directory ...) primitive to find all .l0 files.
;;    b. Read and parse all files into a list of ASTs.
;;    c. For each function definition in each AST:
;;       - Use the dependency-analyzer to find all functions it calls.
;;       - Store this relationship in a hash-map representing the graph.
;;    d. Return the graph.
;;
;; This file is currently a placeholder. Its implementation will be the
;; primary goal of the next development cycle.
